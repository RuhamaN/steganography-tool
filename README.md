Python based steganography tool to encrypt and decrypt data in images without explicitly changing their appearance because the data in encoded using only the LSBs of the pixel channels.

Just copy the code in VS Code, run it and enjoy playing around with a technique used extensively by the Germans during World War 2 for secure and hidden communications!
